This is Ð° GBIF Hosted Portal, displaying data extracted or associated with articles published in [Italian Botanist](https://italianbotanist.pensoft.net/).

**Italian Botanist** is published on behalf of the Italian Botanical Society [www.societabotanicaitaliana.it](www.societabotanicaitaliana.it). Founded in 1969 as Informatore Botanico Italiano, the journal was initially conceived as a place to publish proceedings of the Society, book reviews etc. During the years, however, the journal acquired scientific contents so that, in 2015, the Italian Botanical Society moved it to the Pensoft platform, with the new name Italian Botanist, in order to disseminate its contents more efficiently. It publishes original research covering all fields of Botany in its wider sense, from molecular to ecosystem levels, including Mycology. The geographical coverage of the journal is specially focused on the Italian territory, but studies from other areas are also welcome. It is a peer-reviewed, open-access, journal.
